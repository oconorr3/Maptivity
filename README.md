Real-time data visualization has increasingly become an essential element of business intelligence. Real-time data visualization in the form of charts, maps, and other graphical representations are enabling business users to better understand data.  Businesses can use this data to achieve tactical and strategic objectives in a timely and efficient manner. Real-time data visualization is prompting a cultural shift toward more analytic, data-driven business operations by empowering users to explore, data through a simpler, visual medium, data that was previously available only in overwhelming and time-expensive tabular reports. 

One of the key benefits of real-time data visualization is that it enables users to more effectively see connections and recognize patterns between operating conditions and business performance. With today’s highly competitive and fast paced business environment, finding these correlations between data sets has never been more important. In order to understand these improvements, we will bring to light just a few use cases for real-time data visualization:

## 1) Aesthetic Display 
Many companies have waiting areas and unused visual displays throughout their business area which could benefit from a real-time visualization feed. 

 ## 2) Resource Management 
Real-time visualization can aid managers in discovering and correcting inefficiencies long before legacy analysis would have signaled an abnormal deviation. 

## 3) Crisis Management
Descriptive analytics delivered periodically do little for a decision maker concerned with getting customer services up immediately. Change is inevitable by the time such analysis is available. Conversely, real-time visualization of assets in a variety of geographic locations allows decision makers to allocate resources where they’re needed at most as soon as they are needed.

## 4) Sales Research
With increased ability to understand target markets, real-time data visualization gives companies a tremendous amount of flexibility to get more products out to consumers they may have missed (with tabular data). 

Maptivity aims to bring all of these elements into a single and simple to use real-time data visualization tool. It will strive to provide unique real-time interactive visual reporting and analysis solutions for a wide domain of company applications. Its analytics will be customizable to each client’s needs and goals for analysis. 

Ultimately, it is a tool built to work with a wide range of different data sets and can be tailored to fit the motives of any company. In the form of a generic and extensible website that provides geospatial visualizations of data sets in real-time. This project will serve as a baseline for launching a data analytics platform that can be utilized to influence intelligence and productivity decisions for small companies and businesses.
